# GitHub Copilot Setup for BitNet-OG

This repository is configured for optimal GitHub Copilot experience. This document explains the configuration and how to get started.

## What's Been Configured

### 1. Copilot Instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
This file provides GitHub Copilot with project-specific context including:
- Project architecture and structure
- Coding conventions and patterns
- Key concepts (quantization, kernels, model formats)
- Common workflows and best practices

### 2. VSCode Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)
Optimized settings for:
- GitHub Copilot enablement across all file types
- Inline suggestions and completions
- Python and C++ development
- File exclusions for better performance

### 3. Recommended Extensions (`.vscode/extensions.json`)
Suggested VSCode extensions including:
- GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat
- Python development tools
- C++ development tools
- Git integration and utilities

### 4. EditorConfig (`.editorconfig`)
Ensures consistent code formatting across different editors and IDEs:
- 4-space indentation for Python and C++
- 2-space indentation for YAML and JSON
- UTF-8 encoding and LF line endings

### 5. Contribution Guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Development setup and prerequisites
- Coding standards for Python and C++
- Testing procedures
- Pull request process

### 6. Issue Templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)
Structured templates for:
- **Bug Reports**: System info, reproduction steps, logs
- **Feature Requests**: Use cases and implementation considerations
- **Model Support Requests**: Model specifications and testing capability

### 7. Pull Request Template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)
Checklist-based template ensuring:
- Clear description of changes
- Testing verification
- Performance impact assessment
- Documentation updates

## Getting Started with Copilot

### For VSCode Users

1. **Install GitHub Copilot**:
   - Open VSCode
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot"
   - Install both "GitHub Copilot" and "GitHub Copilot Chat"
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Open the Project**:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/dayour/BitNet-OG.git
   cd BitNet-OG
   code .
   ```

3. **Install Recommended Extensions**:
   - VSCode will prompt you to install recommended extensions
   - Click "Install All" or select individual extensions

4. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Check that inline suggestions appear as you type
   - Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I)
   - Test with a simple question about the codebase

### For Other Editors

While optimized for VSCode, the configuration is editor-agnostic where possible:
- **EditorConfig** works with most modern editors
- **GitHub Copilot** is available for Neovim, JetBrains IDEs, and more
- **Contribution guidelines** and templates work everywhere

## Using Copilot Effectively in This Project

### Ask Copilot About:
- **Project Structure**: "Explain the directory structure of BitNet-OG"
- **Code Understanding**: "How does the kernel generation work?"
- **Implementation**: "How do I add support for a new model?"
- **Debugging**: "Why might the build fail on ARM?"
- **Best Practices**: "What quantization type should I use for x86?"

### Example Copilot Prompts:

```
# In Chat
"Show me how to convert a HuggingFace model to GGUF format"
"Explain the difference between TL1 and TL2 kernels"
"How do I set up the development environment on macOS?"
"What files do I need to modify to add a new model?"

# In Code (as comments)
# Convert model from safetensors to GGUF with i2_s quantization
# TODO: Add support for new quantization type
# FIXME: Handle edge case for models without attention heads
```

### Leverage Context Files:
Copilot uses `copilot-instructions.md` automatically. Refer to specific sections:
- Model support patterns
- Kernel configuration examples
- Common error handling
- Performance optimization tips

## Tips for Contributors

1. **Read the Copilot Instructions**: Understanding the project context in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` will help you work more effectively with Copilot.

2. **Use Inline Suggestions**: As you type, Copilot will suggest completions based on the project context. Press Tab to accept.

3. **Chat for Exploration**: Use Copilot Chat to understand unfamiliar parts of the codebase before making changes.

4. **Document Your Intent**: Add comments describing what you want to do - Copilot will suggest implementations based on those comments.

5. **Review Suggestions**: Always review and test Copilot's suggestions. It's a helpful tool, but you're responsible for the code quality.

6. **Update Documentation**: If you add new patterns or conventions, consider updating `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Troubleshooting

### Copilot Not Working?
1. Check you're signed in to GitHub in your editor
2. Verify your GitHub account has Copilot access
3. Ensure the Copilot extension is enabled
4. Try reloading the window (Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Reload Window")

### Suggestions Not Relevant?
1. Ensure you've opened the project root in VSCode (not a subdirectory)
2. Check that `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is present
3. Try being more specific in your comments or prompts
4. Review the context Copilot is using

### Performance Issues?
1. Check the `files.exclude` settings in `.vscode/settings.json`
2. Ensure `build/`, `logs/`, and `models/` directories are excluded
3. Consider disabling Copilot for very large generated files
